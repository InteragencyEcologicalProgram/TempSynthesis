Read in all CEMP data, make hourly, and same dates as dataframe used for Depth Climate synthesis paper
Used Cat's code from depthdataintegration
used for publication to EDI 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```



```{r read}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(readr)

## read in the files, not sure if this is working due to the errors I keep getting

##Sarah Perry  4:41 PM you can do df <- subset(df, select -c(X9))
##that'll drop the column
###(not sure what ur dataframe is named but just put it there instead of df lol)
## X9 column was only in ANH and MAL

ANH_bottom <- ANH_bottom[-c(9)]
# Added below to remove extra column in MAL and also add datetime designation so it can be binded with other files later
MAL_SURF <- MAL_SURF %>%
  dplyr::select(-X9)%>%
  mutate(DATE = as.POSIXct(DATE, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", tz = "America/Los_Angeles"))
MAL_bottom <-MAL_bottom[-c(9)]

#continue with Cat's template vis depthdataintegretion

```

Prepare and Merge (bind) Files
* Rename columns to match integrated dataset
* Rename stations to match integrated dataset
* Merge all bottom stations together
* Filter by QAQC Flag (G = Good, U = Unchecked)
* Merge middle and bottom stations to undergo standardized QC with integrated dataset


```{r}
# Merge bottom files together
# Rename stations
# Rename columns


###bottom

bottom <- do.call("rbind", list(ANH_bottom, MAL_bottom, MRZ_bottom, RRI_bottom))
RRI <- bottom_clean %>% filter(Station == "RRI")
summary(bottom)
bottom_clean <- bottom %>%
  dplyr::select(c(`STATION NAME`, DATE, VALUE, `QAQC Flag`)) %>% ##### this step is where RRI started only showing dates from the 20th of each month 
  mutate(WaterCol = "Bottom") %>%                         #### starting in 2001 to 2012
  rename(Datetime = DATE,
         Temp = VALUE,
         Station = `STATION NAME`) %>%
  mutate(Datetime = as.POSIXct(Datetime, format = "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M", tz ="America/Los_Angeles"), #Added the Datetime here instead of separately
    Station = replace(as.character(Station), as.character(Station) == "(D12A)  Antioch", "ANH"),
         Station = replace(as.character(Station), as.character(Station) == "(D10A)  Mallard", "MAL"),
         Station = replace(as.character(Station), as.character(Station) == "(D6A)  Martinez", "MRZ"),
         Station = replace(as.character(Station), as.character(Station) == "(P8A)  Stockton", "RRI")) %>%
  filter(`QAQC Flag` %in% c("G", "U"))

###surface

# Some differences in datetime format with MAL_SURF file so had to separate them and fix the datetime before binding them together (2 steps)
surface <- do.call("rbind", list(ANH_SURF, MRZ_SURF, RRI_SURF)) %>%
  mutate(DATE = as.POSIXct(DATE, format = "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M", tz = "America/Los_Angeles"))
surface2 <- rbind(surface, MAL_SURF)

surface_clean <- surface2 %>%                              ###MAL GOES MISSING HERE!!!!! why?!
  dplyr::select(c(`STATION NAME`, DATE, VALUE, `QAQC Flag`)) %>%
  mutate(WaterCol = "Surface") %>%
  rename(Datetime = DATE,
         Temp = VALUE,

#timezone?? code didnt work... dont think it is needed I am moving on. 


```

Final steps
- separate the date out
- Convert to Hourly
- Filter for dates that was used for the paper from RelativeTempDiff2

```{r}
## separate the date out
## trying to get the datetime to be a datetime class

###Bottom

       Day = day(Datetime),
       Hour = hour(Datetime),
       Minute = minute(Datetime)) %>%
  mutate(Temp = round(Temp, digits = 1)) %>%
  filter(Year<2020)

#surface
surface_clean <- surface_clean %>%

       Hour = hour(Datetime),
       Minute = minute(Datetime)) %>%
  mutate(Temp = round(Temp, digits = 1)) %>%
  filter(Year<2020)


```

```{r}
##Hourly

botclean_Hourly <- bottom_clean %>%
  group_by(WaterCol, Station, Date, Hour) %>% #group (calculations) by these vars
  arrange(Station, Date, Hour, Minute) %>% #arrange in order of these vars to visualize duplication
  slice(1) %>% #keep only the first value for each station, date, hour group so 1 value/hour
  ungroup()

##filter the dates out for same timeframe as RelativeTempDiff

FinalHourlyRawdataBottom <- botclean_Hourly %>% 
  filter(Datetime >= as.Date("2012-07-16")& Datetime <= as.Date("2019-12-27"))


###surfacehourly

surface_Hourly <- surface_clean %>%

Write files
```{r}
