## relativetempdiff has all of our parameters: julian day, WY, sinejulian, sinehour etc and is the correct timeframe

## filter the relativetempdiff for each station so I can bring in the models or try the models first
View(relativetempdiff)

RelTempDiff_MRZ <- relativetempdiff %>% filter(Station == "MRZ")
RelTempDiff_RRI <- relativetempdiff %>% filter(Station == "RRI")
RelTempDiff_MAL <- relativetempdiff %>% filter(Station == "MAL")

```{r}
ggplot(RelTempDiff_MRZ, aes(x = Hour, y = RelTempDiff)) + geom_point()
ggplot(RelTempDiff_RRI, aes(x = Hour, y = RelTempDiff)) + geom_point()
ggplot(RelTempDiff_MAL, aes(x = Hour, y = RelTempDiff)) + geom_point()
ggplot(RelTempDiff_ANH, aes(x = Hour, y = RelTempDiff)) + geom_point()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
