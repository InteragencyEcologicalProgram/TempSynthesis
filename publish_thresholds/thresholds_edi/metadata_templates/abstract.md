The effects of increasing water temperature on species in the Sacramento San-Joaquin Delta is of growing importance for conservation and resource management; however, species metrics of temperature sensitivity vary across agency groups and can result in varied understanding and predictions of species vulnerability and modeling. Here, we provide a catalogue of key temperature metrics for several species in the Sacramento San Joaquin Delta that may be used as a standard for scientists studying temperature effects and resource management of native and non-native species. The dataset includes both documented physiological thresholds for suboptimal and upper temperature tolerances from metrics such as growth or critical and lethal limits, as well as calculated minimum, maximum and mean temperature values of species catch in the Delta from long-term monitoring surveys from 1954-2022. Species include critical estuarine fishes such as Delta Smelt, Longfin Smelt, Chinook Salmon, and sturgeon, as well as the species they interact with such as invasive fishes and invertebrates, cyanobacteria, and aquatic vegetation. The dataset includes values for different life-stages where possible and references for information. This information can help guide conservation measures and species management needed to lessen the impact stressful temperature conditions.
